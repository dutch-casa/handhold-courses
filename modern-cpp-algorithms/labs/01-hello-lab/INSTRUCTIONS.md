# Hello, Handhold

Write a program that returns a greeting string.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement `greet()` in `src/solution.cpp` to return the string `"Hello, Handhold!"`
- [ ] Implement `greet_name(name)` to return `"Hello, "` followed by the name and `"!"`

## Hints

Look at the function signatures in `src/solution.h` — the return types tell you exactly what to produce.

`std::string` can be concatenated with the `+` operator.

Use `Run Tests` in the testing panel to check your progress.
