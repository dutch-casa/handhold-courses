# Your first page

Build a personal bio page using the HTML elements from lessons 1 and 2.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add an `<h1>` with your name (or any name you like)
- [ ] Add an `<img>` tag with a `src` and an `alt` attribute (use any image URL or a placeholder like `avatar.png`)
- [ ] Add a `<ul>` with at least 3 `<li>` items listing your interests
- [ ] Add an `<a>` tag linking to any external website
- [ ] Add a `<p>` tag with a short bio paragraph

## Hints

The file already has the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags set up.
Put all your content inside the `<body>` tags.

Every `<img>` needs an `alt` attribute — describe what the image shows in a few words.

Use `Run Tests` in the testing panel to check your progress.
